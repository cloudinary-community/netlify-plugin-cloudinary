### Max Size

The Max Size option gives you the ability to configure a maximum width and height that images will scale down to, helping to avoid serving unnecessarily large images.

By default, the aspect ratio of the images are preserved, so by specifying both a maximum width and height, you're telling Cloudinary to scale the image down so that neither the width or height are beyond that value.

Additionally, the plugin uses a crop method of `limit` which avoids upscaling images if the images are already smaller than the given size, which reduces unnecessary upscaling as the browser will typically automatically handle.

The options available are:

| Name            | Type    | Example   | Description |
|-----------------|---------|-----------| ------------|
| dpr             | string  | 2.0       | Device Pixel Ratio which essentially multiplies the width and height for pixel density. |
| height          | number  | 600       | Maximum height an image can be delivered as. |
| width           | number  | 800       | Maximum width an image can be delivered as.  |

It's important to note that this will not change the width or height attribute of the image within the DOM, this will only be the image that is being delivered by Cloudinary.

## Environment Variables

| Name                   | Required | Example  | Description |
|------------------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME  | No*      | mycloud  | Cloudinary Cloud Name |
| CLOUDINARY_API_KEY     | No       | 1234     | Cloudinary API Key |
| CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET  | No       | abcd1234 | Cloudinary API Secret |

  Cloud Name must be set as an input variable if not as an environment variable
</Callout>

## Setting your Cloud Name

You have two options for setting your Cloud Name: plugin input or environment variable.

### Netlify UI

Inside of your build settings, configure [build environment variable](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/environment-variables) for the following:

```
Name: CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
Value: <Your Cloud Name>
```

### File-based Configuration

Inside your Netlify config, add the following input configurations under your netlify-plugin-cloudinary plugin:

```toml
  [plugins.inputs]
  cloudName = "<Your Cloud Name>"
```
