# Changing the Location of Images

By default, the plugin will attempt to serve any image asset located in the `/images` directory as a Cloudinary asset.

This can be customized by passing in the `imagesPath` input.

Inside your Netlify config, add the following input configurations under your netlify-plugin-cloudinary plugin:

```toml
[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-cloudinary"

  [plugins.inputs]
  cloudName = "[Your Cloudinary Cloud Name]"
  imagesPath = "/my-path"
```
