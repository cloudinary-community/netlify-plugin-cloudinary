# Delivery Type (Fetch, Upload)

## Fetch

**Default** - no additional configuration needed.

The fetch method allows you to use Cloudinary delivery by providing a remote URL.

<Callout emoji={false}>
  If you are currently restricting Fetched URLs, you need to ensure your Netlify URL is listed under allowed fetch domains. Older accounts may restrict fetched images by default. Read more about [restricting the allowed fetch domains](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/fetch_remote_images#restricting_the_allowed_fetch_domains).
</Callout>

## Unsigned Uploads

Unsigned uploads require an additional [Upload Preset](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_presets) set up and configured in your Cloudinary account.

Inside your Netlify config, add the following input configurations under your netlify-plugin-cloudinary plugin:

```toml
[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-cloudinary"

  [plugins.inputs]
  cloudName = "[Your Cloudinary Cloud Name]"
  deliveryType = "upload"
  uploadPreset = "[Your Cloudinary Upload Preset]"
```

Uploading media to Cloudinary gives you more flexibility with your media upon delivery.

Learn more about [unsigned uploads](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_images#unsigned_upload).

## Signed Uploads

Signed uploads require you to set your API Key and API Secret as environment variables.

Inside your Netlify config, add the following input configurations under your netlify-plugin-cloudinary plugin:

```toml
[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-cloudinary"

  [plugins.inputs]
  cloudName = "[Your Cloudinary Cloud Name]"
  deliveryType = "upload"
```

Inside your environment variable configuration:

```
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="[Your Cloudinary API Key]"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="[Your Cloudinary API Secret]"
```

<Callout emoji={false}>
  Environment variables need to be configured in any environment that you're building your Netlify site.
</Callout>

Uploading media to Cloudinary gives you more flexibility with your media upon delivery.
